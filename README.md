# Mapping Earthquakes

## Background

### Purpose

Create an earthquake map visualization with three different maps and earthquake and tectonic plate overlays. The visualization allows for the comparison between tectonic plate location and earthquakes. Earthquake overlays can be chosen to show all earthquake or only major earthquakes (magnitude of 4 or higher). There are three maps to choose from depending on visualization preference. Mapping Earthquakes utilized JavaScript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data.
